Play the original family board game for free wherever you may be. Find out why millions of people have played this classic board game for over 50 years!\r\n\r\nYatzy is a dice game, which was first marketed as \"Yatzie\" in the early 1940s. \r\n\r\nYatzie was included in a game set called \"LUCK - 15 Grand Dice Games\".\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make various scoring combinations. A game consists of thirteen rounds. After each round the player chooses which scoring category is to be used for that round. \r\n\r\nOnce a category has been used in the game, it cannot be used again. The scoring categories have varying point values, some of which are fixed values and others where the score depends on the value of the dice. A Yatzy is five-of-a-kind and scores 50 points; the highest of any category. The winner is the player who scores the most points.\r\n\r\nThe Yatzy scorecard contains 13 different category boxes and in each round, after the third roll, the player must choose one of these categories. The score entered in the box depends on how well the five dice match the scoring rule for the category. Details of the scoring rules for each category are given below. As an example, one of the categories is called Three of a Kind. The scoring rule for this category means that a player only scores if at least three of the five dice are the same value. The game is completed after 13 rounds by each player, with each of the 13 boxes filled. The total score is calculated by summing all thirteen boxes, together with any bonuses.\r\n\r\nThe Yatzy scorecard or score sheet contains 13 scoring boxes divided between two sections:\r\n- Upper section \r\n- Lower section\r\n\r\nA Yatzy is a 5 of a Kind (i.e. all the die faces are the same), and it scores 50 points. If you roll more than one Yatzy in a single game, you will earn a 100 point bonus for each additional Yatzy roll, provided that you have already scored a 50 in the Yatzy category. If you have not scored in the Yatzy category, you will not receive a bonus. If you have scored a zero in the Yatzy category, you cannot receive any bonuses during the current game.\r\n\r\nPlay the classic Yatzy online with buddies or against a series of increasingly challenging opponents.\r\n\r\nYatzy pro game is not only simple, but actually a lot of fun, regardless of whether you’re a child or an adult.\r\n\r\nRoll your way to fast fun with this amazing version of Yatzy HD board game that's been a family favorite.\r\n\r\nUse your math and strategy skills to achieve victory.\r\n\r\nSo what are you waiting for?

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG0ZH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Brightstone Mysteries: Paranormal Hotel HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.11171.9007199266305986.8f7195c0-094d-4d40-9a57-01ac714c1ad3.63fbe675-ef5c-45f5-b1f3-bac92ecfbf3a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034797","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.2367.9007199266305986.0a450b6c-e1dc-4e16-9ee1-2834cc4ff3eb.e94d4c0a-ac55-4ed7-bd92-c03a4935ba06","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034797","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.BrightstoneMysteriesParanormalHotel_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["55d71e93-7a7d-0808-0236-9124824c3bdb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Unravel the secrets of the Templars and an ancient Egyptian cult in this thrilling adventure!\r\nNew York City Detective Bridget “Biggi” Brightstone has come to France to crack the case of a missing necklace in a haunted castle-turned-hotel.

This thrilling mystery merges elements of classical horror and gritty, 50’s-style noir. \r\n\r\nA paranormal private investigator is contacted by her friend, famous reporter Helen Hunter, whose voice sounds small and terrified in the voicemail. She is in the coastal town of Serpent Creek, and needs help immediately.  \r\n\r\nBut upon arriving in Serpent Creek, the detective finds no trace of Ms. Hunter. And the manager of the nearby hotel, in which she supposedly stayed, claims to have never even seen her.\r\n\r\nWeirder still is the fact the town’s streets are crawling with snakes, and the citizens seem to be sleepwalking through life. The ground shakes with violent tremors.\r\n\r\nThis case will certainly challenge the protagonist’s skills as a detective. She must save her friend, reveal the corruption and hidden agendas of the town’s citizens, and, most importantly, stop an evil plot to bring the Snake God back to our world.\r\n\r\nWhen investigating Serpent Creek, the detective will perform true investigative work: finding clues and combining them to learn the secrets of every crime scene in the all new Detective Mode! What’s more, she will crack codes, pick locks and solve clever puzzles along the way.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDHB8P","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Perfect Shift","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38015.9007199266339250.0f8aef31-84a2-49e5-b275-4b415af9801b.0937569e-abcd-4a95-a393-fab39f9dff35","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54139.9007199266339250.11f46f4a-88a2-4d18-a6ee-093ef44fccde.1081b795-923d-43a7-b33f-6b65815bc73b","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.55628.9007199266339250.e20fe469-ca50-49bd-8fc2-1a92315635db.58c75688-e45d-40ba-a3ff-267e40c0c9fa","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["Lextre.PerfectShift_j7ch1pvxn64yc"],"ContentIds":["658cfc8b-c6eb-6fcc-769b-5850067bd7fb","b5c26436-4eb8-1ad7-019c-c64e8bbeaa62","081ed016-2973-572d-1e38-bd9e2abb45ed"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"*** Windows Phone Store Spotlight Featured & Top Ranked in All Markets ***\r\n\r\n«A fantastic game to fill your need for speed» - Windows Central\r\n\r\n«One of few must-have apps for your new tablet and smartphone» - Daily Star\r\n\r\n«A visually stunning drag racing game» - WinBeta\r\n\r\nList of Top-100 apps: «a fantastic looking drag racing game» - Lumia Conversation UK\r\n\r\n***Due to popular demand, the Perfect Shift soundtrack can also now be downloaded on xBox Music, so you can listen to your favourite tunes from the game even when you’re not playing!***\r\n\r\nThis high-octane Perfect Shift game lets you compete with challengers in a visually stunning 3D race environment that looks great on any device.\r\n\r\nChallenge the toughest opponents to race in abandoned tunnels, on deserted city streets and dark industrial areas.

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH554GD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dominoes (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58471.13510798887868271.18737bc3-829b-4715-9e89-7528307e1ebf.b78df613-2b5e-4921-ab26-b125a18319ad","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20880.13510798887868271.2b3677a9-5f18-4c6e-9927-2a55fe7bc915.98fdc08d-86b4-49c0-81fe-9d9f80243aa1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.DominoesFree_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["9d9228e9-cfa4-092c-3e5b-39ca0d0143b3","8f88c0d0-ceeb-f162-e7dc-39ef33385093"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Enjoy this free timeless classic in Draw, Block and All-Five (Muggins) modes.

The player with the lowest double in their hand makes the first move. \r\n\r\nExcept for Block dominoes, if a player cannot make a move, they must draw dominoes from the boneyard until they get a domino that they can play. A player who cannot make a move and cannot draw because the boneyard is empty \r\nor they are playing Block dominoes, must pass their turn. \r\nIn All-Fives dominoes, If a domino is played and the sum total of all four sides is a multiple of 5, the player earns those points.\r\n\r\nThe round is complete when a player plays all of their tiles, or when a game is blocked and no more moves can be made. At the end of a round, the player with the lightest hand (least number of dots on their remaining dominoes) \r\nwins a point bonus - sum of all of their opponents dominoes minus any dominoes still left in the winner's hand.\r\n\r\nTo move tap a domino you want to place. If there is only one place it can go, game will place it automatically. Otherwise tap or drag-and-drop it to the connecting domino.\r\n\r\nThis free version is supported by 3rd party ads.
