The basic game strategy of Gin Rummy is to improve one's hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. Gin Rummy has two types of melds: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, and runs of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit. Deadwood cards are those not in any melds. Aces are considered low, they can form a set with another aces but only the low end of runs. A Gin Rummy player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all the sets, all runs, or both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal Gin. \r\n\r\nDeveloped specifically for the the Phone and Tablet with an intuitive interface, Gin Rummy will be a pleasure to play and pass time anywhere, anytime.

Choose between different opponents, each with a different playing style, select one who matches your skill level and try to earn the most points. Sort your cards to form sets and runs, keep an eye on your opponent and use the right strategy to win! Are you able to get a Gin?\r\n\r\nIt's a method generally known as \"draw and discard\", because at each turn you draw one or more cards from a stockpile and throw out an unwanted card in exchange. Your aim in doing this is to form your hand into sets of matching cards, or melds. \r\n\r\nToday, Gin Rummy is one of the most popular forms of Rummy. As with all games in the Rummy family, you must try to arrange your cards into sets and sequences and lay them down as quickly as possible. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the game for the two players is to get groups of the same values or sequences in the same suits to be able to knock. You should pay attention to what cards you lay and which ones your opponent selects. The player with the lower value after laying wins the round. The winner of the entire game is the player who reaches the agreed number of points first.\r\n\r\nCard games are a big part of life. Whether you’re young, old, or middle-aged, you’ve probably played some card games in your life. The thing with card games is that you might love them, or you might absolutely hate them. But you have to respect them due to the amount of skill it takes to become proficient in any type of card game. So Gin Rummy is obviously here to stay.\r\n\r\nThe basic game strategy of Gin Rummy is to improve one's hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. \r\n\r\nIt is probably the greatest of the traditional rummy games, and one of the best traditional card game for two players. The game is great because of its relatively long hand time, it's incredibly high skill ceiling, and its low skill floor.\r\n\r\nGin Rummy, you can only master, appreciate and enjoy the game well when you start playing the game.

Its clear focus makes the game a delight for children and a winning choice for parents.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer for your children to play the game silently, you can give your child headphones.\r\n\r\nOnce your child is involved and happy, you can relax, with the assurance that he or she is having a great time – and learning!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFZQX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kids Colors (Preschool)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52546.9007199266294587.ed69da2f-cd93-454c-aba5-094dd45aa99d.6cf240be-41a0-438b-afdf-ad312769c987","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#3F8CD1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7467.9007199266294587.74ecb0d9-6c4a-4e7a-9843-9758eb9ae0ed.bc9bd36e-66b8-4b6c-bea2-d94a4c59f563","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3F8CD1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1807.9007199266294587.968df4b3-b2fb-4104-b97b-45c00ce9e3c6.639e6744-4d6d-404d-a161-1b74e0e0d7ad","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3F8CD1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47836.9007199266294587.7221283f-ef52-4ce7-b43d-7826c21cc04b.008eadc1-743d-401d-9ecf-b05bd32275c6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#3F8CD1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Intellijoy.KidsColorsPreschool_aeskzhp7pykjg"],"ContentIds":["37fb7beb-062a-25b4-cda7-8409db6f7e3c","4e63578a-9fcf-2473-bad3-28eca331fd41","a3beb78f-2ef1-59c1-dda9-18bf47b00099","9f33326b-a5f5-44e3-20ca-2f2007ee6340"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Kids Colors lets toddlers and preschoolers learn to recognize colors and name them in ways that are really fun.\r\n\r\nThe game is from Intellijoy. We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG0ZH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Brightstone Mysteries: Paranormal Hotel HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.11171.9007199266305986.8f7195c0-094d-4d40-9a57-01ac714c1ad3.63fbe675-ef5c-45f5-b1f3-bac92ecfbf3a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034797","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.2367.9007199266305986.0a450b6c-e1dc-4e16-9ee1-2834cc4ff3eb.e94d4c0a-ac55-4ed7-bd92-c03a4935ba06","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034797","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.BrightstoneMysteriesParanormalHotel_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["55d71e93-7a7d-0808-0236-9124824c3bdb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Unravel the secrets of the Templars and an ancient Egyptian cult in this thrilling adventure!\r\nNew York City Detective Bridget “Biggi” Brightstone has come to France to crack the case of a missing necklace in a haunted castle-turned-hotel.

This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.
