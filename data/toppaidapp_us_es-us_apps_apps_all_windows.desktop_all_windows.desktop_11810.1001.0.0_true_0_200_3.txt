Brush 2 is a drawing app focused on the strong yet beautiful feel of the East Asian ink brush.\r\n\r\nIt is unique as a realistic ink painting simulation that reproduces the delicate and vivid strokes of an East Asian ink brush. Users can easily enjoy genuine Asian calligraphy and ink wash painting with a simple and intuitive user interface imbued with the Zen spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Windows universal app version of Zen Brush 2 already supports the Surface Dial and the new Surface Pen with tilt support, providing the feeling of a real ink brush by reflecting the brush's tilt and orientation.\r\n\r\nMain Features :\r\n\r\n■3D Ink Brush Simulation\r\nThe app includes a drawing system based on a 3D model of an East Asian ink brush. Strokes change according to the movement of the user's finger or pen, providing a sensation just like a real ink brush for a uniquely varied and deep expressiveness.\r\n\r\n■Ink Nijimi and Notan\r\nUsers can select from 3 types of ink dispersion (nijimi) and enjoy the complex, three-dimensional expressiveness of ink-wash painting where the ink gradually soaks into washi (Japanese paper). The thickness of the ink (notan) can also be adjusted to reproduce shades ranging from dark, thick ink to light, diluted ink so users can create subtle artwork by combining shadowy depictions and light coatings.\r\n\r\n■Abundant Style Templates\r\nArtwork expressiveness is enhanced by choosing from a collection of 92 rich background style templates, including washi (Japanese paper), old paper, patterned paper and many more.\r\n\r\n■Support for Surface Dial and Surface Pen\r\nWith Surface Dial, users can use Zen Brush features intuitively without needing to touch their keyboard and mouse. Thanks to support for the Surface Pen's pressure sensing and the New Surface Pen's tilt detection, users can enjoy an even more realistic ink brush experience.\r\n\r\nFeatures :\r\n\r\n- 92 background style templates.\r\n- Simple brush size adjustment with slider.\r\n- Simple main tools: ink brush, red brush, eraser brush.\r\n- 3 levels of ink dispersion (nijimi).\r\n- 3 levels of ink tone (notan).\r\n- Guide lines (9 types).\r\n- Undo / redo (5 levels).\r\n- Save projects in the app.\r\n- Save artwork to image file (formats: JPEG / PNG / Transparent PNG (without background)).\r\n- Sharing (transfer data to other supported apps. Example: email).\r\n- Adjustable pressure sensitivity (5 levels).\r\n- Adjustable tilt sensitivity (5 levels).\r\n* Requires a pen that supports tilt.\r\n- Supports Surface Pen (eraser supported).\r\n- Supports Surface Dial (undo / redo, brush size adjustment, tool switching (ink brush, red brush, eraser), zoom in / zoom out, style change, brush axis rotation, 90 degrees canvas rotation).","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NHZ2GM2QM5S","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Typing Instructor for Kids Platinum","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49846.13616880065086573.0b468e62-a858-497e-8d21-c3267e77e7ff.0d4fdaf1-c542-4ed5-bd23-e7265630ea42","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#777777","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$19.99","Price":19.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["IndividualSoftware.TypingInstructorforKidsPlatinum_p27trh1f1z4np"],"ContentIds":["0a011046-7bdd-165c-7744-d347df24da55"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"*** Typing Instructor for Kids Platinum is not Windows 10s compatible ***\r\n\r\nTyping Instructor for Kids Platinum \r\nThe Exciting Way for Kids to Learn to Type!\r\n\r\nKids learn to type on an exciting adventure on Typer Island.

You can specify absolutes indices within the names or indices relative to a particular string or regular expression.\r\n\r\nAdditional features include:\r\n• Undo/Redo functionality.\r\n• Support for regular expressions.\r\n• Sorting of files and folder.\r\n• Error checking to ensure that your file and folder names are valid.\r\n• Tooltips to help to what each element does and how to use it.\r\n• Logging so you can lookup if any errors occurred.\r\n• The ability to move and copy along with renaming.\r\n• Collision options so you know exactly what is going to happen with you files and folders.\r\n• The ability to theme the app yourself!","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NMCJ2R73GJJ","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"TwitchTvPlayer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22203.13694520998181319.f77b9dea-ef59-4c72-92df-7f3730b492e6.2d94fa8e-0b88-4ba9-9d02-7ab3b35e738c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#6441a5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35254.13694520998181319.49596453-97ba-423a-84bc-8a41c7c84496.92608b8c-625a-4871-9d0d-44366c2ef243","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#6441a5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$2.99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["25840botserver.TwitchTvPlayer_aee9h1yy8fgcc"],"ContentIds":["0a732fb8-4e52-403a-56ac-b467fafa40cd","3134bfb7-16a0-d402-ef50-61ca54829939"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One,Móvil","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The Fastest Twitch.tv Player.\r\nCan view past broadcast, search games, streams, chat, etc.\r\nNo ads, publicity. banners, etc. \r\nWatch streams without interruptions.\r\nSuper clean interface.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NQ4ZCM6FX8N","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"PhotoPad","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42670.13776078062490539.414a1c52-2ea3-4a26-a0d0-919d2bc8c9e5.6f383616-0061-46d7-a57a-82930606cb0f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26627.13776078062490539.cee6510e-8066-4c4a-b4b1-b58224a0e4fa.edffe115-ff20-42d6-9575-986a870baa4d","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$49.99","Price":49.99,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["NCHSoftware.380169444E55D_7kedsbyvzns34"],"ContentIds":["f52b514f-94c2-d94c-49a3-714ad4754d25"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"PhotoPad is a powerful and easy to use digital photo editor.

Juntos, todos los programas interactúan perfectamente entre sí y son de ayuda para cualquier usuario.\r\n• Utilidad para archivación 8 Zip Pro;\r\n• Administradores para carpetas y archivos Pro y Metro Commander Pro;\r\n• Cliente torrent de Torrex Pro;\r\n• Navegador de Internet Pro, un navegador para Xbox;\r\n\r\nEste conjunto se complementará muy pronto con nuevas herramientas esenciales.\r\n\r\nPor supuesto que todas estas aplicaciones se pueden comprar por separado, pero si usted compra la licencia general, ¡usted ahorrará por lo menos el 20 %!\r\n\r\nNota importante: Es evidente que el precio de dicha aplicación aumentará con el lanzamiento de cada nueva herramienta. Entre más pronto la compre, más barato será el conjunto de licencias.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NTVP5PD1P1M","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Express Scribe Pro","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50449.14410826211487546.75a6bce5-ef97-4832-b685-df3b415b66e8.3848de9e-6d2b-41fb-af53-e7c8c6f9c772","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54738.14410826211487546.d88ec62b-b10e-4b6b-a508-acb749269faf.ad384243-45a8-4b4c-8ad9-f57aafb9868c","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48673.14410826211487546.eb9168db-dac9-4674-8645-2a92b56e1545.47f153a8-fcd3-4e91-9595-2d12b7a4d5a4","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$59.99","Price":59.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["NCHSoftware.ExpressScribeTranscriptionSoftware_7kedsbyvzns34"],"ContentIds":["07c5e63a-b04f-baf7-f611-9c62bb5f8417"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Express Scribe Pro is professional quality audio software designed to help you transcribe audio recordings.

Unlike text editors, which are designed to edit files that contain text data, hex editors allow you to edit files that contain any type of data.\r\n\r\nCygnus is fast. Very fast! Operations such as searching, or searching and replacing are blazingly fast. And screen updates and most other operations will be instantaneous on all but the slowest computers.\r\n\r\nCygnus is easy. With intelligent features such as a multiple document interface (MDI), the ability to easily insert and delete bytes, simple drag and drop operations, bookmarks and more, complex editing tasks can be performed with ease. And with our new Data Inspector, editing data values can be accomplished more naturally than ever possible before.\r\n\r\nOur Find and Replace dialogs make finding data easier and more powerful than ever before. The Find dialog box divides searches into three types: text, data types, and raw data. And the Replace dialog box allows the same logic to specify both find and replace parameters. Want to search for the Unicode text \"Hello\" and replace it with a FILETIME value of 3/31/2005 9:25:00 AM? Well, maybe not. But with Cygnus, this is extremely simple and intuitive to do.\r\n\r\nOf course Cygnus allows you to edit data by typing in hex or ASCII values. But Cygnus provides powerful new ways to modify data as well.\r\n\r\nThe Data Inspector window allows you to view and edit data in a more natural way as known data types, structures, and arrays.\r\n\r\nThe Modify, Insert and Delete dialog boxes allow you to instantly perform certain operations on any number of a particular data type.\r\n\r\nThe convert function will convert the selected data to another format. Convert data using any of the existing conversion types or write your own conversion add-in by writing a Cygnus extension.\r\n\r\nIn addition to modifying data, sometimes you just need to know a little more information about that data. Cygnus offers new tools for this as well.\r\n\r\nCygnus now offers intelligent file comparing. It is intelligent because it can compare files of different lengths, and it can resynchronize matching data after a difference has been found.\r\n\r\nCygnus also now offers checksum computations. Simply select the data you want to perform the checksum on, and then select any of the available checksum algorithms to compute that checksum. You can even add new checksum types to Cygnus by writing a Cygnus extension.\r\n\r\nTo get the most out of any Hex Editor, you'll want to be able to export and import various types of data. You&#39;ll also want many options for copying data to and from the clipboard.\r\n\r\nCygnus provides great flexibility in this area.

The HDR processing pipeline can be used to recover significant details from the image's highlight and shadow. \r\n\r\nThe app also allows you to acquire images directly from the Windows device's back facing camera (limited HW compatibility)\r\n\r\nSupported image merge method :\r\n  - Exposure fusion (generates SDR image directly without tonemapping)\r\n  - Exposure weighted merge (genearte true HDR image, require tonemapping to compress the dynamic range for viewing and printing)\r\n\r\nInput format supported:  JPG (8bpc),  TIF (8bpc), TIF (16bpc)\r\nInput raw file format supported: 3FR, ARW, CR2, CRW, DNG, NEF, ORF, RAF, RW2.\r\n\r\nOutput format:  JPG (8bpc), TIF (8bpc), TIFF(16bpc), Radiance HDR(32bpc)\r\n\r\nInput images should alter only in exposure time, not aperture nor ISO settings. They do not have to be in equal EV steps, The images should have the exposure time in its EXIF tag in order to use the exposure weighted merger.\r\n\r\nTo capture a series of images for HDR:\r\n - Set your camera to JPG(FINE) or TIFF image quality\r\n - Set your camera to bracket mode, with compensation to either 1.0EV or 2 EV per step, and 3 or 5 frames. You could go for more frames if the scene require higher dynamic range.\r\n - Set the camera's burst mode to high if available, this shortens the time need to acquire the images and reduce image alignment requirement later on\r\n - Set the camera on a tripod or a stable place, \r\n - Release the shutter to capture all images.\r\n\r\nLoad all images (JPG/TIFF) into the app and select the desired merge method and tonemapping method. Once satisfied the preview result, tap generate HDR to generate the full-res picture. Adjust the light/contrast/toning and hit save.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this app require a lot of system memory when merging images. For device that come with less than 3GB memory, please use no more than 3x12MP images.\r\n\r\nThis app uses 'libraw' library for RAW processing. For more details please see: https://www.libraw.org/ .

In such cases, the entire large video could be sent by splitting it into multiple small videos using the application.\r\n-- You could divide the large video into videos of smaller duration and upload them to your website. Later on you could provide the links of each part separately to download.\r\n-- Apart from this, wherever there are size limitations for the video, the application could prove to be very beneficial by splitting the videos into smaller sized videos.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PMV6B0GCNWZ","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Music Maker Plus Windows Store Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6058.14286272411668344.ddc3bd5e-9324-4f4d-a690-57f40b776e8f.bb158d83-b46c-4f8d-b591-fca8e00106a5","Height":200,"Width":200,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27834.14286272411668344.1df7ff5e-93ad-4a38-ab47-c4c1631e85d6.dce80a34-2423-484f-970e-938cca685f06","Height":600,"Width":600,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8734.14286272411668344.d1436f0c-c149-4e7f-b15d-f60be473877e.77e06a13-e6ea-4649-af91-c84db97e591c","Height":176,"Width":176,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64055.14286272411668344.70384d28-c55e-4536-a46e-fd0605e8e472.9afd7535-9d6f-42ab-b36b-a9ad32deaf61","Height":1240,"Width":1240,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18117.14286272411668344.20233688-02a8-4dea-a1b0-0f4d7e18b589.f39d6e89-9efb-4ab7-8657-9945173c1d8a","Height":284,"Width":284,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29020.14286272411668344.ee1168df-c4aa-4a58-bdc9-a1ccead34ceb.cb994fbf-1e16-4f4f-845f-f4d98cf90dbc","Height":600,"Width":1240,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"USD$59.99","DisplayPrice":"USD$29.99","Price":29.99,"AverageRating":2.9,"RatingsCount":"10","PackageFamilyNames":["MAGIXSoftwareGmbH.MusicMakerPlusWindowsStoreEditio_awcgk3qbzve1y"],"ContentIds":["866363ec-c3b6-87e3-5b08-d2d737f22cbb"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"AHORRA USD$30.00","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Making your own music is easy with the Music Maker Plus Edition.

These beautiful SuperNotes have capabilities far beyond those of mortal men (and the ones stuck to your refrigerator).  Privacy is Key!  Each SuperNote can be Encrypted and Decrypted using Industrial strength algorithms to prevent prying eyes from seeing your data - no matter who is watching over your shoulder.  And you can use an individual,  note-specific password, or a Global password for encryption.  With each SuperNote, you can also change Size, Color, Placement, Pin it to the background and send them via email.  Enlarge or shrink them without losing data and change the look of the background whenever the mood strikes you.  You will never need anything else to keep track of your reminders and personal notes and to keep them Private!  And now you can Share your SuperNotes with Twitter, OneNote, Facebook or any other \"share-able\" app.\r\n\r\nDo you post a lot of notes? Do you lose track of where they are? Our new search feature lets you narrow down the list of notes you have to read through to find the one you want. This is a great time saver and lets you post notes without worrying that you’ll be unable to find them later!\r\n\r\nNow you can also Encrypt or Decrypt All SuperNotes at one time!\r\n\r\nOur newest feature is the ability to Draw on your note...and encrypt your drawing!  No other note APP has this ability.  You can draw (using your finger on a touch-sensitive device) or your mouse and if you choose to, encrypt that drawing so NO one else can see what you've created.

Featuring five different ways to learn about the body: The VIEWER, ACTIONS, 3-D MODELS, six types of QUIZZES, and MEDIA. \r\n\r\nVIEWER: The viewer allows you to control a 3D view of the body, with labels that lead to full screen images of 145 muscles each with the name, action, origin, insertion, nerve supply and comments for each muscle. The viewer also includes all the bones with detailed landmarks. \r\n\r\nACTIONS: The best way to learn about muscles is to group them into their actions. In this section, choose from over 37 body actions, and see an animation of the action, with a visual list of muscles that perform that action, plus comments in each section. \r\n\r\n3D MODELS: There are seven 3D models, each model allows you to control a body area in 3-D space, with multiple stops along the way that identifying the structures and give comments on each area. Models cover the ankle, knee, pelvis, shoulder, face, hand, and a detailed look at the vertebrae. \r\n\r\nQUIZZES: 6 types of quizzes! 18 pages of label matching quizzes where you have to match a name to the correct location. Multiple choice quiz builder that allows you to test the name, action, origin or insertion for each muscle. Skeletal quiz tests your knowledge of each bone name. These two quizzes feature adaptive quizzing which adds your missed answers to the Favorites, allowing you to test yourself on only what you have missed (or create your own quiz on just what you want to learn). The Action quiz tests your knowledge of every joint action in the body. The Spelling quiz tests spelling of muscle and bone names. The general quiz tests your knowledge of general muscle and bone anatomy subjects. You can also email your scores to an instructor or friend. \r\n\r\nMEDIA: Thirty beautiful pages of basic muscle and bone info along with common musculo-skeletal conditions. Five imbedded videos (16 minutes) that give the basics of the muscular and skeletal system. These videos cover the arm, torso, face, leg, and fascia.\r\n\r\nIf you want to experience the future of digital education, this app is a great example of combining beautiful imagery, knowledge and interactivity, utilizing the full power of the tablet. \r\n\r\nThis app is used at multiple anatomy programs across the country.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG8PR","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Pencil Drawing Tutorial","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20146.9007199266302138.39799449-9ec1-4236-9187-a66009199621.e7cd2a0f-b7c3-43aa-b136-f1237e750ad6","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46688.9007199266302138.214a565f-6006-4094-97dd-9b1189c83820.2e252c18-5520-43a3-b826-3ab0b9be6a1e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$4.99","Price":4.99,"AverageRating":3.3,"RatingsCount":"10","PackageFamilyNames":["38731basquang.vn.DrawingTutorial_pyvvk3yw15sng"],"ContentIds":["b87687db-7681-085d-b914-fcaee371e741","91eb1c3d-f3dd-8ba4-8c04-339c4ee79954"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Móvil","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you enjoy drawing, if you're an artist of if you want to be an artist and/or learn to draw, so this app is right for you, a great reference to start.

It's a sophisticated automatic chromatic tuner and tone generator suitable for tuning a wide range of musical instruments including guitars, basses, ukuleles, violins, violas and cellos.\r\n\r\nIts large, easy to read display is ideal for tuning even at a distance, and the carefully designed white-on-black appearance is ideal for use in dark performance environments. modTuner Pro also offers a black-on-white theme, along with a range of attractive backgrounds to suit your mood or style.\r\n\r\nThe high quality tone generator and can reproduce tones from C1 to B8 (provided your speakers can handle it!) Sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveforms are provided. The tone generator also has a Ping-Pong mode which will automatically play back the closest note to the one you just played to help when tuning by ear.\r\n\r\nmodTuner Pro uses a sophisticated digital signal processing algorithm to accurately and reliably detect the fundamental frequency of the note being played. modTuner Pro's background graphic glows when a reliable tone is detected, providing you with greater confidence while tuning.\r\n\r\nAlthough very easy to use, modTuner Pro has a number of advanced features including Drop/Capo/Transposition tuning, a wide range of temperaments, Concert A calibration, strobe tuning, High Sensitivity and Noise Filter modes.\r\n\r\nDrop/Capo/Transposition enables drop or capo tuning, along with transposition which can be used to change keys for instruments played in a key other than C, for example alto saxophones (E flat) or trumpets (B flat).\r\n\r\nConcert A can be calibrated in steps of 0.1 Hertz to allow you to match the tuning of another instrument. modTuner Pro can listen to another instrument to calibrate Concert A, or you can select a desired frequency directly.\r\n\r\nThe High Sensitivity mode is provided to help when tuning certain instruments that may not be detected as easily by modTuner Pro.\r\n\r\nThe Noise Filter listens to your environment and reduces or eliminates noise that may make tuning difficult.\r\n\r\nmodTuner Pro automatically uses the sound source selected as Windows' default recording device, enabling it to be used with almost any sound source Windows recognizes.\r\n\r\nmodTuner Pro; the reliable chromatic tuner that makes it easy for you to keep your instruments in

an application that allows you to remotely control your digital SLR camera while tethered to your computer.\r\n\r\n* Remotely control camera settings\r\n* Remotely fire the shutter release\r\n* Stream Live View to your computer\r\n* Shoot a time-lapse sequence\r\n* Auto save and view photos on your computer as they are taken\r\n* Import/Export camera settings (Snapshot profiles)\r\n* Import camera settings from digital photographs\r\n\r\nSnapshot requires a Canon digital SLR camera connected to your computer via USB. Once connected, the simple to use interface allows you to view and change your camera's current settings using the drop-down boxes.\r\n\r\nFor cameras that support Live View mode, you can now stream the Live View to your computer.\r\n\r\nCaptured photos can be displayed on your computer using the built-in Snapshot Viewer, or choose your preferred photo viewing app, e.g. Photoshop, and automatically save them to a folder on your computer.\r\n\r\nShoot a time-lapse sequence with the new time-lapse controls - configure the Interval between each frame and the initial Delay before capturing the first frame, and choose whether to capture a fixed or unlimited number of Frames.\r\n\r\nYou can also export a 'snapshot' of your camera's current settings which you can later apply back to your camera quickly and easily.\r\n\r\nImport camera settings from digital photographs by extracting the settings (ISO, F Stop, Exposure Time, etc) that were used when the photograph was taken, and set up your camera in exactly the same way. This can give you a good starting point for taking similar shots, and help you get to grips with the overwhelming range of settings your digital SLR camera has to offer.\r\n\r\nSupported Cameras\r\n\r\nSnapshot currently supports the following Canon camera models:\r\n\r\nEOS 1D Mk III\r\nEOS 1Ds Mk III\r\nEOS 1D Mk IV\r\nEOS 1D X\r\nEOS 1D X Mk II\r\nEOS 1D C\r\nEOS 5D Mk II\r\nEOS 5D

Instead of worrying about syntax details, the Visual Basic programmer can add a substantial amount of code simply by dragging and dropping controls, such as buttons and dialog boxes, and then defining their appearance and behavior.\r\nAlthough not a true object-oriented programming language in the strictest sense, Visual Basic nevertheless has an object-oriented philosophy. It is sometimes called an event-driven language because each object can react to different events such as a mouse click.\r\n\r\nThis collection of 200 Video Tutorial Lessons Will soon get you up to speed.\r\n\r\nUse this app as a “Video Referencing Library” where you can come back for a refresher lesson or search for how to do something new.\r\n\r\nApp features:\r\n** Keep your own set of user notes.\r\n** Move the video around it's group and even change it's group.\r\n** Make videos your favourites and give them your own rating\r\n** Search by title or notes \r\n** View by favourites or rating\r\n** View by history the last ten played or visited videos\r\n\r\nLessons include:\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 1 - What Is Visual Basic\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 2 - Installing The Visual Basic IDE\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 3 - Getting Familiar With The IDE\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 4 - Hello World\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 5 - Primitive Data Types\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 6 - Comments And Whitespace\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 7 - Errors\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 8 - Variables\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 9 - Math Operators\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 10 - More On Math Operators\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 11 - Getting User Input\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 12 - Creating A Basic Calculator\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 13 - If Statement\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 14 - Else If And Else\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 15 - Nested If Statements\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 16 - Conditional Operators\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 17 - Logical Operators\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 18 - Concatenate Strings\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 19 - Get Length Of Strings\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 20 - SubStrings\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 21 - Formatting Strings\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 22 - Replacing SubStrings\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 23 - Comparing Strings\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 24 - Select Case\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 25 - Select Case Else\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 26 - For Next Loop\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 27 - Step Operator\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 28 - Exiting For Loop\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 29 - Continue For\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 30 - Do Until Loop\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 31 - Do While Loop\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 32 - Exit Do Loops\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 33 - More On Do Loops\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 34 - Nested Loops\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 35 - The Infinte Loop\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 36 - Introduction To Windows Forms\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 37 - Form Properties\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 38 - ToolBox\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 39 - MessageBoxes\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 40 - MessageBox Input\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 41 - Input Box\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 42 - User Defined Subs\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 43 - Functions\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 44 - ByVal\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 45 - ByRef\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 46 - Optional ByVal\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 47 - Coercion\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 48 - Exit Subs\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 49 - Events\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 50 - Global Variables\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 51 - Constants\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 52 - Math Class\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 53 - CType\r\nVisual Basic Tutorial - 54 - Calculator Part 1\r\n\r\nand more.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N43D3DTXXSD","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Mobile Legends Guides","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43401.13990977692331355.95c4d37a-11fb-4c26-8207-3652ed196d31.1c40a915-b4bb-4c34-8eda-262a210ede93","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29273.13990977692331355.95c4d37a-11fb-4c26-8207-3652ed196d31.9748293f-f798-4d72-b0a3-333f7aac99d8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$2.09","Price":2.09,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["27501jananapps.MobileLegendsGuides_x3hm8ndfy66r2"],"ContentIds":["fdbf66cd-164c-b23a-3da2-66602d43122e","b5d944c8-d9b9-496f-223f-854c77c5c745"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This app guides you to play most popular Mobile Legends Game with best experience.

Allows you to speed up the process of drawing - mirror displays the contents;\r\n* Cycle management.  It makes it unnecessary to create additional frames to repeat. You can create an animation with an infinite repetition, boomerang and a certain number of repeats;\r\n* Backup projects. It makes backup copies of the workflow, thus preventing loss of data upon failure of the program: emergency shutdown, reboot the computer, etc.\r\n\r\nOPERATING MODES IN AMONTAGE\r\n* GIF animation mode.

Simplifies the process of drawing a frame, dividing the elements of the picture into different layers;\r\n* Timeline. Allows you to create, delete, duplicate frames. Select several frames, move them, clear them. When you select a frame, the canvas displays its contents;\r\n* Color palettes.

The palette is automatically formed in such a way that all the necessary colors are always right at hand;\r\n* Thematic palettes. We decided to regularly add various thematic palettes, which turned out to be a very useful and popular feature of the program.\r\n\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF IMPORT/EXPORT\r\n* Import images. Allows you to create animations from photos or from a set of images, make a slide show, add an image to the drawing animation;\r\n* Export PDF. You can export a PDF book, storyboard animation or as your own comics;\r\n* Export a set of images (sequence). Export each frame as an image in the specified format;\r\n* Export Speed painting video. You can get a speed painting video in one of the formats: *.avi, *.mp4;\r\n* Save/Open the project.

Just enter a keyword and leave it up to Live TV Player to do the rest. It will scour the web for M3U playlist files that match that keyword. Example keywords you can enter include \"Italy\", \"movies\", \"news\", \"sports\" or any keword that represents the type of television channels you want the app to create for you.\r\n\r\nShortly after, a message will pop up to let you know how many live TV streaming URLs it counted in the free M3U playlists it collected and give you an estimate of the processing time. Each live TV streaming URL is tested for validity.\r\n\r\nThe search can be configured by Country, Language and Depth. Depth represents the extent of the search. If a Depth 1 search does not generate enough channels, try a higher number. Be aware that even a Depth 1 search can take a long time but the estimate will be given in the pop-up message mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n2) Do your own search\r\n\r\nUse Google from inside the app to target specific web pages with live TV streaming links. To find such web pages, enter the keywords \"extinf m3u8 free iptv\" followed by the keyword representing the type of television channels you want the app to create for you. Once a page is found, click 'Process site content'. Navigation is done using the Back and Forward buttons.\r\n\r\n3) Upload a file\r\n\r\nThis option is applicable if an M3U playlist file has already been saved in a location you can navigate to using Windows Explorer.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the search, all the valid live TV streaming links are converted into television channels that can be accessed through the Channel Selector dropdown underneath the Video Player.\r\n\r\nThe Video Player offers standard functionality. You can Rewind, Fast forward, Pause and Stop video, and vary its playback rate although this last feature does not work on all channels.\r\n\r\nThe next screen is the Channels Presentation and Management interface. You can edit channels individually by right-clicking and modifying the name. You can also select and delete channels.\r\n\r\nThe Export button lets you export the channel data into an M3U playlist file.

is a deeply immersive VR series that allows audiences to experience the wonder and majesty of the ocean through different habitats and come face to face with some of the most awe inspiring species on the planet. The series, which is directed by Jake Rowell (Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, Superman Returns), has been designed as beautiful moments in passing or a collection of memories that powerfully tap into the vast potential of VR. The debut episode, featuring an incredible close encounter with an 80 foot whale, is already recognized as one the most iconic room scale VR experiences to date (a Sundance Film Festival 2016 selection). Additional episodes in this bundle take place on a teeming coral reef and in the very deepest region of the ocean. Gain access to new modes of discovery in each episode. Slow time and capture pictures in Inspector Mode, and return to a meditative version of each location in Ambient
