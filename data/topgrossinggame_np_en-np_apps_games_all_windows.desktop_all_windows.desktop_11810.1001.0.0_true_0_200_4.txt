Kingdoms is about forging alliances, political mind games, city-building and castle sieges with thousands of other players. Cast as a feudal lord or lady, players begin with a single village and keep. They must design and defend their castle before turning their eye to the rest of the country, Europe and the world! Whatever path they choose players will find strength in numbers as they band together, uniting with local Factions and player-led Houses.\r\n\r\nBesiege the castle that’s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction’s war efforts, pillage your neighbor’s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all! Factions, elections, liege lords and their vassals come together to form a feudal community of real players with whom to discuss strategies and build allegiances.\r\n \r\nWhile an impregnable castle should be at the heart of any kingdom, you can also specialize with a vast research tree. Starting as a humble peasant each promotion provides valuable research points to spend on trading, diplomacy, warfare, farming or religion. Beware as your power grows so does your responsibility.

Each of the foundation piles must start with an ace and end with a king.\r\n♣ The cards from the 7 columns can be placed in descending order by alternating between red (hearts and diamonds) and black (spades and clubs). For example, you can place a 5 of hearts on a 6 of spades. \r\n♣ You are allowed to move runs of cards between columns. A run is a set of cards with numbers in a descending order and alternating colors.\r\n♣ If you ever get empty columns you can place a king or any run starting with a king.\r\n♣ When you run out of useful moves you can continue by tapping on the deck at the top left of the screen. You will draw 1 card or 3 cards depending on the type of the level. If there are no more cards in the deck tap on its outline to draw more cards from the beginning.\r\n♣ You should try to expose more and more cards as quickly as possible. Important cards might be buried under other cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n♥♥ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

They can hear and/or see the ball traveling around the court, which is at eye level. The goal of the game is to hit the ball back and forth with a partner or computer player until one player misses the ball with their paddle; this scores a point for the other player. With each hit, the ball speeds up slightly, adding an extra layer of challenge and excitement. The first player to score seven points wins the match.\r\n\r\nAudio feedback:\r\nBall audio – A fine-tuned combination of low-frequency humming and high-frequency ticking, along with other contextual sound effects, makes the ball easy to locate with audio alone\r\nPlayer location cues – Unique sounds indicating the side walls and center point of the court let the player know where they are at all times\r\nOpponent feedback – Similar “paddle impact” sounds play for both the player and their opponent, indicating when and where the opponent has hit the ball","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PN25V5XBLLJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Clans of Clash - Battle Royale","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27447.14353023909191715.96656a4c-13be-4fbd-a8ae-8e873f60125b.d2c5af36-7423-42b0-ad48-6701252dc43f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1387.14353023909191715.96656a4c-13be-4fbd-a8ae-8e873f60125b.181aa54c-40a8-40a1-80c3-b943bb04006a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["46658CrazyLabsLogicGames.ClansofClash-BattleRoyale_9crxbt5as2fvp"],"ContentIds":["9fba659e-fbf9-ad7f-d674-6198b76765ca","068c17db-bb0d-198f-8ac9-fe4605db11fa"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Clans of Clash - Battle Royale is an exciting royale battle and castle defense game with Superheroes!

As the bird has a huge passion for mini golf but there are no golf clubs (sticks) and balls to play with, he has reinvented some parts of  the game concept.\r\nHe blows up his clumsy body until he looks like a ball and uses a slingshot to move towards the hole.\r\nAfter the first shot the game play will change from slingshot modus to arrow modus with a power bar, for a more precise stroke.\r\nAdvice: Remember that the first hit will be the most difficult, so do not put too much strength in it because it will simply make our fluffy friend, fly out of the track.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Awesome 3D graphics\r\n- Cute animal characters and animations\r\n- 4 amazing courses with over 70 holes\r\n- Simple, drag-and-release gameplay mechanic for the slingshot\r\n- Direction arrow with power bar for the successive par\r\n- Realistic physics and ball movement\r\n- Collectible fruit like, bananas and water melon to increase your score\r\n- Easy and funny to play\r\n\r\nTry to find the shortest and easiest path to the hole in order to rise your score. If you can make it with no more than 3 par (hits) you will get three stars.\r\nThere are also collectible bananas and Water melon slices that can increase your final score.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one water melon piece you will get back one par (hit) which means that you have higher possibilities to get 3 stars.\r\n\r\nJoin this crazy bird on his holiday at the beach and have some real fun playing this epic game.\r\n\r\nChallenge your friends and show them who the king of the trucks is!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG1V9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Secret Society - Hidden Mystery","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30442.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.a1f68e71-0df4-44a0-b446-85e6616d5455","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7278.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.f923621d-329f-4129-92b4-cc260499bf13","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36746.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.5f80cc20-98c7-4a63-b3e0-c7f40ab4d1a0","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35023.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.a8896fd1-96af-4450-a03e-5b17751561ec","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55625.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.5d2cdc49-e3e8-4489-9ce5-6efd1aec3bff","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26051.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.c4d33e64-3093-485a-a81f-05d05bdfb719","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8829.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.7e68c6b9-324f-4358-b7b2-c64510e4d678","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32118.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.eb55292a-d6c0-4a5b-8086-0cb0935ac716","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13488.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.c7121d02-850c-4c6b-8386-42ca78d7e93d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36657.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.80a6a789-3b23-4f63-8576-d77994fb19da","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.8,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.TheSecretSociety-HiddenMystery_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["076fc4eb-6fc5-e9ee-70b1-39ad10db366c","86f4f1bf-59ae-19cf-3b44-176885a43c25","0daf8426-2815-35fc-0b25-3221576f34c9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"LIMITED TIME OFFER!
