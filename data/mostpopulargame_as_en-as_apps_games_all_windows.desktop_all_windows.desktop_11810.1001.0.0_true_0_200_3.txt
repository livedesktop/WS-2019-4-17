The killer whale is in a ferocious mood. The thrill of controlling a fierce angry whale is unmatchable. Angry whale simulator 2016 is a super animal simulator and gives you a chance to watch and simulate a killer whale attack in deep sea and on the beach. So dive into the ocean and be a part of this adventure as an Angry Whale as this orca knows no stopping.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal simulators give you the opportunity to observe the wildlife and sea animal life from a close perspective. Angry Whale Simulator 2016 will give you that chance of controlling a whale that attacks and eat underwater animals and humans alike. The Orca whale experience is better than the shark jaws or piranha. Whales are huge animals that can stay both in deep and shallow waters and once they come close to surface, can run havoc on the beach and the boats. So feed the whale by attacking the targets and make sure you stay out of the range of hunters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAngry whale needs food to survive and you have multiple missions that include attacking people on the beach and animals in the sea. The killer whale is out on the hunt. Use the on screen navigation controls to swim in water and reach the target. Happy hunting\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the Angry Whale Simulator 2016 game. Your comments & ratings are welcome and will help us in creating even better games for you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDN9BV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Klondike Solitaire Collection Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44123.9007199266467213.16f966bd-91b3-499d-b5d0-624670f995ee.4f95761d-3b5d-4ccf-a1ca-a9e78f8f7fc1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15536.9007199266467213.2e5fe63e-6a57-454d-9bf2-3b777360a886.edff3f0c-fe47-4fef-8db7-6da479bd9707","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27720.9007199266467213.b83937e7-abfc-4976-8af1-6167f0b59caf.db342d0a-df4a-4d35-8c82-16fd573163b9","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20751.9007199266467213.f7770934-d3ef-4bed-8758-ae8afac05c85.5a6ca0fa-c92d-4bb7-93cf-c75bb973fa25","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10097.9007199266467213.53e68378-de60-4404-89be-b527f305002b.1370432f-f205-452f-994f-b734c7ba9cf2","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48652.9007199266467213.1fff2ed9-a145-40c7-8898-2d2bdb0d7505.3296d161-e06f-43d9-8352-7dda1d8ef064","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13661.9007199266467213.45376708-4b7a-4358-b0d2-aa676a2716ac.21b99ca1-adae-45a8-959c-4394b10e6bdd","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64312.9007199266467213.5d7fa4f2-0c04-4471-8934-5ef3c490f3b0.7151fb2f-f473-4cea-acfc-9825177f7560","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57286.9007199266467213.281bf202-7f92-4065-9a6d-3e7f85664107.8526cbd3-0637-4572-8ed4-e7c1101e7a86","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1A9056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TreeCardGames.KlondikeSolitaireCollectionFree_n666hb6ddc5jp"],"ContentIds":["54bd1739-9aa6-2aaa-2ef6-15c26015f944","6c2c51cd-beb9-f99c-f079-ca93c913bc21","11a1a2ba-9394-70ab-8106-b034a3a77ccc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play a free beautiful collection of Klondike solitaire game variations, including:\r\n- Klondike\r\n- Klondike by Threes\r\n- Klondike Two Decks\r\n- Easthaven\r\n\r\nWe support our apps and your feedback is welcome.

billions of hours of lost productivity over the years. Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NJRX71M5X9P","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cuphead","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35072.13670972585585116.70570f0d-17aa-4f97-b692-5412fa183673.25a97451-9369-4f6b-b66b-3427913235eb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFCF10","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11400.13670972585585116.3fb2cb95-9b27-4388-853f-b110577014ab.1b2ce764-a292-4502-86a3-48e420cd9b3a","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFCF10","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32325.13670972585585116.ed68aaa9-1815-4dc1-aaa2-7055cc26ed45.7001f86a-595b-4f41-a1b9-5f6b7b6916b0","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFCF10","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37905.13670972585585116.7f29dc82-c969-4e89-aaf9-7c0e3f52d890.2e5a9c92-cf00-4c10-ae28-264c564478c3","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22008.13670972585585116.b194a7d4-ad8d-4e23-ab53-349c6d12eba0.92dfce54-5825-4bc5-a546-cb36bcd292fe","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35072.13670972585585116.70570f0d-17aa-4f97-b692-5412fa183673.25a97451-9369-4f6b-b66b-3427913235eb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFCF10","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$19.99","Price":19.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["StudioMDHR.20872A364DAA1_tm1s6a95559gt"],"ContentIds":["fec01b60-2942-ae63-ca81-7d3d99f466d9","6359cea7-c103-b06c-431b-93c88cdc9c99","33643ae5-50de-4b09-9eb6-fffa3c69a459"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles.

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4S7B8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Monster High Dress Up","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26069.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.09a84f3d-73cf-4899-b741-38a4491229e1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7852.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.5623eb27-8271-4cba-9d28-4832cbad2cf0","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40329.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.a9d76c7f-28cd-489a-b18d-e20e973115be","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28818.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.7ce63c60-3759-4a1a-ae78-133bb34e0fa4","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14365.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.e60d6f0b-953f-4fea-a3df-538e5947297b","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36490.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.8154f88f-04e5-48d7-8d60-9bc3dc9b0f20","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35428.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.becb2614-6b41-4648-b7e2-3b847e31698d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45083.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.531a1cd5-c6f1-42fa-8765-4634ed8fca84","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55824.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.81cb76de-45a0-460b-92aa-38c62ad70a10","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28704.13510798887573143.856c912e-77b1-4cb1-a07b-bbff8bb4efbe.0b9c4582-30e4-4dff-9dfe-acd0eb40da2d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2468AppolloGame.MonsterHigh_a6h44nqn6pbdm"],"ContentIds":["01617f63-05d9-71b6-03af-a46e552a3ba7","41f87c26-ed58-8a1c-1416-57ef1f7126ae","8db5a44a-f12b-e9ce-9e6b-8270638f4249","d51367ba-fbe0-be53-6563-280c76f61061","dc3c7608-b500-d376-8738-7ea096396a3f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Monster High Dress Up application created for lovers of Monster High.
