The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe. You will experience both city and off-road environment and view many scenic views of mountains and hills while you are driving in the snowy conditions. Drive the extreme snow bus drive away!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the game. Your comments & ratings are welcome and will help us in creating even better games for you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5BWG7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"InstantChess","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14201.13510798886844240.9ccaee35-0763-4113-a186-477e66973284.20ba5073-bde1-498a-a259-27b8a35e8a57","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28729.13510798886844240.ec9f0bf1-946a-4707-bbab-e994507d022d.0cd49048-9483-405b-8bc1-caf861648645","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4522.13510798886844240.51942b3e-3358-4587-af34-39afada95a76.f5a4c892-8c5e-449a-8fd4-5466ca916d0f","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42725.13510798886844240.6f80c6ff-32ff-46f2-9978-7999af85430e.63f7eec1-0eb2-4590-90ba-b131c58dc0a5","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39687.13510798886844240.6ea07099-5602-458e-b23e-30c56f808158.721e4b2e-b41f-446d-a7ed-5be83ae8b4ed","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5671.13510798886844240.011a80da-1206-499c-bdc2-9777f733ece6.4767b185-7b82-48c1-92cf-1855a4dac4ab","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28729.13510798886844240.ec9f0bf1-946a-4707-bbab-e994507d022d.0cd49048-9483-405b-8bc1-caf861648645","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17678.13510798886844240.7ccfbcd0-14a5-4b85-b12a-f71bb4c2e569.2c11a1b0-aa44-4b3e-a1b3-4ed45139bc58","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33506.13510798886844240.19ec370d-1e75-4efe-a01a-0c0b7f33e06b.5ae8ff4d-f5e0-48ca-a82e-2289a6deec8a","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["InstantChessLimited.InstantChess_nmwwqc817pnja"],"ContentIds":["5812f16e-ffa7-52e9-1857-38c588673426","44d36981-3247-0234-4f79-cf5604ed40b1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"PLAY CHESS, NOT WAR! لعب الشطرنج، وليس الحرب\r\n\r\nPlay live chess with opponents worldwide.\r\n\r\nWith a great proportion of players from Middle East (30%), Europe (25%) and North America (20%), InstantChess offers a perfect battlefield for a clash of minds.

billions of hours of lost productivity over the years. Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NJRX71M5X9P","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cuphead","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35072.13670972585585116.70570f0d-17aa-4f97-b692-5412fa183673.25a97451-9369-4f6b-b66b-3427913235eb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFCF10","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11400.13670972585585116.3fb2cb95-9b27-4388-853f-b110577014ab.1b2ce764-a292-4502-86a3-48e420cd9b3a","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFCF10","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32325.13670972585585116.ed68aaa9-1815-4dc1-aaa2-7055cc26ed45.7001f86a-595b-4f41-a1b9-5f6b7b6916b0","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFCF10","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37905.13670972585585116.7f29dc82-c969-4e89-aaf9-7c0e3f52d890.2e5a9c92-cf00-4c10-ae28-264c564478c3","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22008.13670972585585116.b194a7d4-ad8d-4e23-ab53-349c6d12eba0.92dfce54-5825-4bc5-a546-cb36bcd292fe","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35072.13670972585585116.70570f0d-17aa-4f97-b692-5412fa183673.25a97451-9369-4f6b-b66b-3427913235eb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFCF10","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$19.99","Price":19.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["StudioMDHR.20872A364DAA1_tm1s6a95559gt"],"ContentIds":["fec01b60-2942-ae63-ca81-7d3d99f466d9","6359cea7-c103-b06c-431b-93c88cdc9c99","33643ae5-50de-4b09-9eb6-fffa3c69a459"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles.

But the more you delve into this secluded island and the twisted family relations of the owners, the more complicated and unclear this case becomes.\r\n\r\nTRY IT FREE, THEN UNLOCK THE FULL ADVENTURE FROM WITHIN THE GAME!\r\n\r\nA rookie inspector on her first assignment and her experienced copartner arrive at the scene – a luxurious island in the middle of the ocean owned by a young millionaire, who wants the matter concluded as quietly as possible. The question in this case appears simple enough:  was a security guard's death a suicidal plunge, or maybe an unfortunate fall? \r\nThe residents of the island - the Bradford family - at first seem cordial and beyond reproach, even shocked by the death of a friendly employee. But upon closer inspection it becomes clear that they harbor animosities and deep hidden motives. The more you delve into this secluded island and the twisted family relations on it, the more complicated and unclear the matter becomes. A seemingly routine case turns into a tale of machinations driven by greed and a suicide investigation reveals multiple murders.\r\nIs anyone innocent?

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4S7B8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Monster High Dress Up","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26069.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.09a84f3d-73cf-4899-b741-38a4491229e1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7852.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.5623eb27-8271-4cba-9d28-4832cbad2cf0","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40329.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.a9d76c7f-28cd-489a-b18d-e20e973115be","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28818.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.7ce63c60-3759-4a1a-ae78-133bb34e0fa4","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14365.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.e60d6f0b-953f-4fea-a3df-538e5947297b","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36490.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.8154f88f-04e5-48d7-8d60-9bc3dc9b0f20","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35428.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.becb2614-6b41-4648-b7e2-3b847e31698d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45083.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.531a1cd5-c6f1-42fa-8765-4634ed8fca84","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55824.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.81cb76de-45a0-460b-92aa-38c62ad70a10","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28704.13510798887573143.856c912e-77b1-4cb1-a07b-bbff8bb4efbe.0b9c4582-30e4-4dff-9dfe-acd0eb40da2d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2468AppolloGame.MonsterHigh_a6h44nqn6pbdm"],"ContentIds":["01617f63-05d9-71b6-03af-a46e552a3ba7","41f87c26-ed58-8a1c-1416-57ef1f7126ae","8db5a44a-f12b-e9ce-9e6b-8270638f4249","d51367ba-fbe0-be53-6563-280c76f61061","dc3c7608-b500-d376-8738-7ea096396a3f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Monster High Dress Up application created for lovers of Monster High.

years who learn how to read in English. \r\n\r\nThe evil Snow Queen has frozen the letters of the English alphabet and the poor animals were taken into the icy captivity.

In order to do that your child has to learn English letters and combine them into words, which represent the names of the captured animals. \r\n\r\nIt’s not a big secret that many kids can face difficulties learning to read in English, because English letters in real words have different pronunciation rules in comparison with their sounds in the English alphabet. \r\n\r\n“Learn to Read & Save the Animals” educational game offers efficient Phonics techniques in order to learn how to read in English. During the process of playing the educational game the children will hear the sound of each English letter in exactly the same way as it’s pronounced in the shown word. \r\n\r\nIt allows your child to understand the rules of English word reading on the subconscious level. Kid will simply feel how to pronounce the English words, without suffering and trying to find the transcription of the word in thick English dictionaries.\r\n\r\nThe game offers 3 educational levels free of charge.

Words of the very first level contain just 2 or letters, while the words of the last level may have up to 7 or even 8

If there’s one thing we know how to do is how to have terrific garage sales! There is a saying that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure which we believe is very true. So, today we are organizing a neighborhood Garage Sale. This annual event has become a drawing card for treasure hunters from all over the town, where everyone can benefit as both a buyer and a seller.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that this garage sale is one of the most successful in the country. Karen, Sarah and Thomas are customers at our neighborhood garage sale. Consistently finding the good stuff at yard sales is their mission. Like any mission, it requires strategy. They have prepared themselves how to choose their target, plan their attack, assemble the necessary gear, and get in and out fast. They even made a map which lists locations and categories of what is being sold at each location.\r\n\r\nNow they are starting their search around the site for shopping and bargaining. A bargain is almost guaranteed on garage sales.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,
