This game is quite addictive, that's for sure because it is very popular. If you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe or Zumas Temple Quest. It's about our version of the famous Zuma. For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again. Actually if you are not satisfied by our score in general, you could play again each level you want. Now let's see how is this going in praxis.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

The new versions of the game are much brighter and diverse. Retris is one of the best in our opinion, although one can find dozens of Bricks, Blocks, Pentomino and 1010!-like games in the Internet. But it is still essentially the same game that was originally Quadris (classic puzzle Tetris).\r\n\r\nYou can choose number of figures – 9 as in the classical version; 11 – a mix of three and four bricks; Pentax, 17 – all the figures. You can moderate type of figure movement (fluent/intermittent), initial speed, figure colors (as in Tetcolor). At the same time there are no frills, and classic Tetris and Tetcolor lovers might grow fond of it.\r\n\r\nRetris has two color modes: in the first one all pieces of a certain type consist of blocks of the same color. The bottom part that is not burned is composed of disparate units if mixed colors - the remnants of the thrown shapes.\r\n\r\nThe second mode is when a falling figure is composed of red blocks, and the bottom blocks (made of the fallen ones)  are blue.\r\n\r\nRetris provides an opportunity to show a transparent grid that divides a figure into blocks.\r\n\r\nThe game can show a “phantom” – an identical “twin” of a falling figure to help you see where it is better to place it.\r\n\r\nOne can choose a mode of control type in Quadris: if you prefer to play holding your smartphone or tablet with two hands, you can select a mode in which the control buttons are situated to the left and to the right from the game field.\r\n\r\nThere is also an option \"play with one hand\" in Quadris, the control buttons are placed to the right from the playing field on your smartphone or tablet screen.\r\n\r\nYou can compete with other players as in many other puzzle games. It is possible to play anonymously or to register and get your unique nickname. After that your results get into the global chart.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the auto-save function if your game is interrupted by a call or any other program switch on the smartphone!\r\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n- Create horizontal lines using the falling blocks;\r\n- When you make a line of blocks, it is cleared from the screen;\r\n- The game is over when the blocks pile up and reach the top of the screen;\r\n- You get more points for completing multiple lines at once.\r\n\r\nYou can play the new version of Quadris either online and offline. The game may be of interest both to adult fans of the classic Tetris game and to attract the younger generation, it is as easy to use as educational online games.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of classic puzzle games – Tetris and other related puzzle games like Quadris, Pentax, etc. – has been repeatedly studied by scientists. If one believes their opinion, downloading a free puzzle game (like Quadris or Tetris), you get both a free shrink and a free nutritionist – it is believed that classic puzzle and logic games may relieve stress, may help to ease one’s condition after psychological problems and may reduce the risk of overeating by switching attention to the game. As opposed to the \"shooters\", Quadris and other classic puzzles can calm, giving a feeling that you put your life in order and under control along with the blocks on the playing field.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and join the wonderful company of smart puzzle-crackers!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4W9M8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Candy Camp Story","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36796.13510798887525641.21308a3c-db93-43d4-8b87-c2d6ea2e1307.7cb78049-90f3-46c5-b6e7-66d2ecb9401f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26254.13510798887525641.c6843713-6278-44bd-a446-59284ea40366.5cf328a9-dc05-4e8d-ab88-82cfcc53409a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8310.13510798887525641.74a474b4-ce81-4ea0-ba77-a460d7a55868.09d8adc2-8a13-4f27-81bd-6c8bf17b00ba","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51209.13510798887525641.8fe0973b-1b1c-4ad5-a0bf-b0998ae12cbc.0c69a6e9-c00c-4279-a903-f85af74196a8","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["KOONOOZ.CandyCampStory_3b9qn4fqp6kcr"],"ContentIds":["2720482a-85d6-b087-d526-a6984fd4ba81","d89cf62b-4356-4272-cb7c-0a1b95ce4ff9","26cce683-657d-4fc5-b530-8a2eb7577b49","ae029564-204b-7945-b144-627cecfecd8c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"🍬 The Sweetest Candy Game Ever 🍬\r\nBig fan of delicious Match-3 puzzle games?

There are plenty of glittering gowns to choose from that will make this ice queen stand out.

The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDQX65","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Death Drive: Racing Thrill","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37350.9007199266544510.6ae1d73a-a382-4d8b-8472-1e441aa8a372.79be7c81-2a27-4601-a1f0-fe3089c2684a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#202020","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35366.9007199266544510.c5feada7-b6d7-4b82-9848-649b81f526c3.d4c24038-6cc1-4295-bb57-adbb1d0de196","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#202020","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["PlayBuffStudiosPrivateLim.DeathDriveRacingThrill_vx8mmcwfbtyhc"],"ContentIds":["22072212-1f0c-cadb-c1cf-37c9309aef28"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"When ACTION meets RACING, thrill moves to another level !! \r\n\r\nAre you ready with your Gears and Guns?
