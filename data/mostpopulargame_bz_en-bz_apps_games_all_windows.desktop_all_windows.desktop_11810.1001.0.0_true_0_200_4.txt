Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5XC9K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"World Cricket Championship 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1065.13510798886389436.c9152b15-0139-4fa4-950d-3f10b7318066.007aaf79-e736-4165-8f5a-d927a8b150fb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56114.13510798886389436.2232dd36-760a-404f-8ff3-8c92a6b3c752.3621d10c-8e9f-498f-b210-c51f15bd464d","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28000.13510798886389436.ae50e3b0-78f1-4a7f-9dfc-8c3565ee5456.de5828ac-8791-4e35-a1a8-f83da54ab82d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30840.13510798886389436.81818586-da0d-4f04-9354-0f87c780bba9.a983fcda-3aa0-4d54-b737-82ec4163c738","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["NextwaveMultimediaPvtLtd.WCC2_jxdd5nhqtb94j"],"ContentIds":["fac009f1-2abf-6741-bad1-0d5c0480787d","34b4e21e-1294-b4d7-37b9-2c0c2f7cc01d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Winner, Game of the year 2015, People's Choice, Nasscom Gaming Forum Awards 2015\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Next Generation in Mobile Cricket Gaming!

Apparently AI is suddenly all the rage however the 2019 edition celebrates 16 years of ZingMagic bringing you the best in AI based board, card and puzzle games. So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again.

The killer whale is in a ferocious mood. The thrill of controlling a fierce angry whale is unmatchable. Angry whale simulator 2016 is a super animal simulator and gives you a chance to watch and simulate a killer whale attack in deep sea and on the beach. So dive into the ocean and be a part of this adventure as an Angry Whale as this orca knows no stopping.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal simulators give you the opportunity to observe the wildlife and sea animal life from a close perspective. Angry Whale Simulator 2016 will give you that chance of controlling a whale that attacks and eat underwater animals and humans alike. The Orca whale experience is better than the shark jaws or piranha. Whales are huge animals that can stay both in deep and shallow waters and once they come close to surface, can run havoc on the beach and the boats. So feed the whale by attacking the targets and make sure you stay out of the range of hunters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAngry whale needs food to survive and you have multiple missions that include attacking people on the beach and animals in the sea. The killer whale is out on the hunt. Use the on screen navigation controls to swim in water and reach the target. Happy hunting\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the Angry Whale Simulator 2016 game. Your comments & ratings are welcome and will help us in creating even better games for you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N2LDNX007RQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Block Puzzle New 2019","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27349.13954209337430403.20b0a65a-30b3-41ce-b8b8-abaaa18ee33e.6d31ac41-f5bc-4cbc-9c10-8ebac294d128","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2494.13954209337430403.20b0a65a-30b3-41ce-b8b8-abaaa18ee33e.e0f209fb-2cbb-49ed-ad82-c5ecef95d638","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["61957Casualgame.1010BlockPuzzleKing_0nt7ynh0rqkt4"],"ContentIds":["3b413f25-a8c5-5368-3dd5-ef553289d248"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Block Puzzle 2019 is a challenging puzzle game with a simple game play.

Crashing model here cost nothing. Learn to fly without fear. Rain or wind outside, start flying right now! \r\n\r\nThe program includes many popular helicopter models of different type:\r\n- Beginners co-axial models\r\n- Entry level collective pitch models\r\n- Advanced fully 3D aerobatic models\r\n- High fidelity scale models\r\n\r\nWe also include many RC plane models, RC boat and RC car models. This is the most complete and realistic RC simulator available!\r\n\r\nNote: we are constantly adding more, you will see them listed when you install the program!\r\n\r\nThe program includes different flying fields, boat and car race tracks.\r\n\r\nWe also includes 3 interactive object sets that can be loaded on any flying field. The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model. That is useful when you just start, so the model never gets away. \r\n\r\nPlease try our full featured professional RC flight simulator ClearView for PC here: http://rcflightsim.com - see the video of ClearView bellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n1. This is not a game. You are controlling flying rc models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls. \r\n2. The onscreen control sticks are just indicators! They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. \r\n\r\n*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** \r\n\r\nSliding your finger any where on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. \r\n\r\nWe suggest to select beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDWQT3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Glory of Generals: Pacific War","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20906.9007199266676726.55a407ae-f577-4137-aa97-6baeb47ecdd4.08f99410-48b0-4430-b669-5c48c3f33b91","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63693.9007199266676726.88cc8693-7f6f-40cc-a6ed-2e4b797bbb46.e390a597-4bc3-4afd-ab67-9148aff0bcb4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7307.9007199266676726.17404895-3ec3-44ca-b8f1-36a83653f9c2.43a706ae-e3b8-4f00-a563-567d3c6f7ce6","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["34006EasyTech.GloryofGeneralsPacificWar_nz34nvfqxfk3r"],"ContentIds":["649b5aa0-a791-4c69-b861-07f5fa721135","a66da570-00ff-8b8e-b0fe-13529531aa5d","1c9db92e-b892-34f1-0c73-19c97471dfd1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Commander！\r\n Over 64 campaigns in 4 battlefields are waiting for your challenge.\r\n 105 world famous generals will participate in this war with you.\r\n Over 300 real and rich terrains will influence your strategies.\r\n\r\n Player needs to make adequate use of battlefield terrains and defense facilities as well as expertise of each unit to win advantage. \r\n Cutting retreat route or encircling enemy will bring great change to battlefield situation. \r\n How to smartly deploy land, naval and air force to seize opponent's key strongholds is a question lingering in player's mind.\r\n\r\n Accumulation of Medals achieved through battles guides your way from soldier to marshal.\r\n Upgrade of military facilities in the headquarters will offer essential supply in the war.\r\n Recruit other officers to strengthen force.
