Be careful not to fly out of the road into the ocean.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PDM6GWQB6ZM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Virtual Villagers Origins 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61116.14151601087113126.828c53bb-382b-4b42-9c18-3995cd8ef7cb.374a6741-a2f0-4011-821c-a7914a516c18","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1287.14151601087113126.3af90a98-29ca-4773-9a40-7f0eeab43c7d.a1ad0ec9-a8c6-4ac6-bbe0-bea645588142","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49393.14151601087113126.f4ecf927-8a7d-488a-8280-4328a0ded7d0.aecf76a0-9b7d-4dd0-b6f0-2afcf7c94f39","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49240.14151601087113126.0fca41be-8c7a-41e2-9598-527e8ab0b152.254fae0a-35da-4700-894e-72f329a71787","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2789.14151601087113126.0fca41be-8c7a-41e2-9598-527e8ab0b152.6faba7eb-ad91-44b8-b97c-5a7e8b9fb43d","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52328.14151601087113126.0fca41be-8c7a-41e2-9598-527e8ab0b152.77c96469-52ee-423f-9619-94a40e23bec6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Bila malipo⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["LastDayofWork.VirtualVillagersOrigins2_d532r1j86my6c"],"ContentIds":["241de778-ed87-cdc6-5832-2819b3e9b21b","f22a2a26-fe85-a246-96e0-5ae37b7f2d7b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Kompyuta","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Craft, farm, solve puzzles and build a thriving village, right in your pocket!\r\n\r\nReturn to the famed and mystical island of Isola and be drawn into the latest sequel in the beloved Virtual Villagers series!

by a prophetic scientist who predicted the fall of mankind and civilization. It doesn't know what has transpired in the wake of the fall or why the world has become so rowdy and violent, all it knows is it hasn't made an arrest in 1230 years and it's got some catching up to do. As it takes in the sheer number of people rioting the earth, the copbot's cloning activates and as he travels beyond the borders of his rebirth, his clones spawn and reign their strict laws over the town. As one of the world's last remaining superheroes, working a desk job at the local precinct, when a mob of copbots storm the district, taking out citizens left and right, he knows he must take a stand and classes from this menace. \r\n\r\nCops Vs Robbers - Survival Craft is a thrilling first person shooter adventure where you can enjoy real time battle with friends and foes from all over the globe. With over 40 weapons to create, equip and use including guns, rockets, grenades, bows, swords and gems, you'll be ready to blow past enemies with stunning finesse. Take out enemies creating or utilizing a plethora of unique strategies or even shoot through walls when you see oncoming enemies approaching on the areal entity map. Collect your daily reward by viewing short video ads, then select your difficulty level and begin fighting. In this initial map, you will be fighting against the clock in order to earn a powerful permanent weapon to carry with you throughout the game.

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG126","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Special Enquiry Detail: The Hand that Feeds HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.10009.9007199266305937.a09eaf92-d005-467f-a158-d01a082e5795.cf30e7f3-0f67-4e67-9cc5-fcadfe5c0d81","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.62445.9007199266305937.da762b7a-c3e7-453e-858c-dd65a7e988a2.ad2520a5-6263-4a33-b367-ab2dcb8ef050","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.49518.9007199266305937.0554e406-7677-42fe-8079-199ab572725a.d419b74b-5540-476f-8c51-6d9c55bd9877","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.64154.9007199266305937.5fcaff3b-0eee-4e35-baf8-604fbfe25b0e.0a1b31a6-536e-4d44-ad2f-d2b057adad13","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.6557.9007199266305937.0225cd92-214e-412d-89b3-bded058523aa.4ce442cc-1b60-4074-bbaf-380e448923cd","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.13776.9007199266305937.13380a24-57bb-40c6-8b1a-0d7d57e4e531.200863e4-a738-4dec-8026-9a3c152793f4","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Bila malipo⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.SpecialEnquiryDetailTheHandthatFeeds_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["bf840ade-be64-b75f-879c-49f8e0a0b157"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Kompyuta","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Try your hand at investigating a crime, crack the case and catch the criminal in this perplexing hidden-object game!

The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar).

In fact, at first glance you might think of it as a bit of a joke. I mean seriously, no graphics or sound at all? What kind of game is that? Long before quality graphics and sound was available on game systems, there were playable stories. Some have called them ‘Interactive Fiction’, others ‘Text Adventure Games’. Instead of using the machine’s graphic and sound capabilities, they used the player’s imagination. This game has been specifically designed to reignite that lost game genre while implementing a modern interface that makes for a surprisingly refreshing gaming experience.\r\n\r\nThis Christian themed story begins with an accident. An accident that leaves you, as the player, unable to recall not only where you are, but who you are as well. Awakening in an overturned van, being suspended by your seatbelt, you must first figure a way of escape. Once free to explore the area, you find yourself in a world that not only seems strangely empty, but openly hostile as well. As the story unfolds and your memory begins to return, you begin to question whether these strange happenings are limited to the immediate area. If your experience of this small town is reflective of the state of the world, then things are certainly not as they used to be!\r\n\r\nA word of warning! This seemingly dark tale is refreshed by a large number of humorous responses that if caught unaware, may have you bursting out in spontaneous laughter. This may cause embarrassment if played in a public place. In fact, no matter how many hours are spent playing this game, it would be nearly impossible to discover every comical response.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDQX65","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Death Drive: Racing Thrill","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37350.9007199266544510.6ae1d73a-a382-4d8b-8472-1e441aa8a372.79be7c81-2a27-4601-a1f0-fe3089c2684a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#202020","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35366.9007199266544510.c5feada7-b6d7-4b82-9848-649b81f526c3.d4c24038-6cc1-4295-bb57-adbb1d0de196","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#202020","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Bila malipo⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["PlayBuffStudiosPrivateLim.DeathDriveRacingThrill_vx8mmcwfbtyhc"],"ContentIds":["22072212-1f0c-cadb-c1cf-37c9309aef28"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Kompyuta","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"When ACTION meets RACING, thrill moves to another level !! \r\n\r\nAre you ready with your Gears and Guns?

Both you and your kids can now easily play your favourite tune or two on a piano, xylophone, guitar, drum, pan flute or a trumpet. The app allows multi touch so you can play and teach accords. Playful design makes it inviting and easy to use, even for a two year old toddler. All the sounds are recorded on real instruments so it may come in handy at preschool music class. It is free and we promise no add will ever interrupt your fun while you are in play mode.\r\n\r\nHypercube would like to thank UK Philharmonics Orchestra for providing real instruments recordings.\r\n\r\nIn Hypercube we put our time, knowledge and effort to the test. Our dream is to find ideas, develop and deliver multi platform mobile apps that stand out in quality and uniqueness of design.
