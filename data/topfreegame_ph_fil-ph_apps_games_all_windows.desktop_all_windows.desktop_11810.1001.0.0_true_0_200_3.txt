A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. \r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudiolay against a friend using the new online multiplayer mode.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. \r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJXT1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Peppa Memory","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.24181.9007199266268904.7586a68c-4af0-4cf8-a4e9-83d8de9f32ab.19e563b7-76aa-4c6a-8403-2bb087239a48","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0099CC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.51744.9007199266268904.c27cba50-fad6-4985-8267-4edd4d7dfe79.6b68cdc0-67ac-4923-b9a7-af63808750eb","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0099CC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Libre⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["51932ColomboEmanuele.PeppaMemory_64vy2y6zhr7gc"],"ContentIds":["531a36cf-ba69-7a14-0442-e9079fa6431f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Peppa Memory game with 3 level, very funny, where you will find many of your favorite characters.

Use your imagination to find words in any hexagonal direction.\r\n\r\nThe game includes many puzzles:\r\n\r\n* Free puzzles\r\nThe game contains 5 game packs that can be played in any difficulty mode and as many times as you want.\r\n\r\n* Ad sponsored Puzzle of the Day\r\nEvery day we offer a unique puzzle that can be played after watching a short video ad. By watching the video ad, you gain access the puzzle and you can play it like a regular free puzzle. Remember to finish the game before the end of the day, as Puzzle of the Day changes at midnight. \r\nIf you want to play Puzzle of the Day without having to watch ads you can purchase a 'Remove ads' subscription or a 'Premium' subscription. See 'Subscription rules' below for details.\r\n\r\n* Paid puzzle packs\r\nWe offer over 16 puzzle packs for sale. The typical puzzle pack contains 25 puzzles. Once you purchase a puzzle pack you can customize the puzzles and you can play them anytime you want.\r\n\r\n* Premium subscription\r\nFor dedicated users we offer premium subscriptions. Users with an active subscription can play any puzzle in our library. We offer two types of subscriptions: a monthly subscription and a yearly subscription.\r\nPurchasing a Premium subscription also removes the Puzzle of the Day video ads.\r\n\r\n* Unlock puzzle pack with crowns\r\nWhen playing Puzzle of the Day you can choose to create an account and participate in our daily contest. Top 3 players that solve the puzzle the fastest receive 1 crown reward each at the end of the day. There are 5 contests every day, one for each difficulty level. The earned crowns can be saved and used to unlock paid puzzle packs. \r\n\r\nSubscription rules: \r\n1. A subscription will start and renew automatically, and will be charged to your Microsoft Account. You can manage your subscription in your Microsoft Account settings. \r\n2. If the subscription includes a free trial period, you will not be charged during your free trial period. If you are happy with the game, do nothing. When the free trial concludes, your subscription will start and renew automatically, and will be charged to your Microsoft Account. To avoid that, you must cancel the subscription before it expires. Any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when purchasing a subscription.\r\n\r\nPurchase rules:\r\nAny purchase you perform in the game can be played even if you reinstall the game, or if you change your computer. Just remember to login with the same Microsoft Account that you used for performing the purchases and you will be able to play all the puzzles you paid for.\r\n\r\nOffline play:\r\n1. All free puzzles can be played offline.\r\n2. All purchased puzzles can be played offline for 30 days. That means that you can travel with your laptop and your puzzles will be available even if you don't have internet access.\r\nAfter 30 days you will need to get internet access in order to refresh the licenses for the purchased puzzle packs. \r\n3. Puzzle of the Day cannot be played offline.\r\n\r\nThank you for playing our game.\r\nWe hope you will have a great time solving the puzzles!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MV3XKP00KCD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Grand Prix Hero Pro","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29028.13800360653588701.e4f4e263-e0f4-4c1e-a018-320e51651016.841c7add-fb17-432a-ab8e-1e8798f6e374","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7314.13800360653588701.e4f4e263-e0f4-4c1e-a018-320e51651016.2c4a4e51-52b2-40ab-9e77-ddfb4902108a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45253.13800360653588701.e4f4e263-e0f4-4c1e-a018-320e51651016.4feb85d7-6774-4205-b904-479c8714a5e9","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59802.13800360653588701.e4f4e263-e0f4-4c1e-a018-320e51651016.458c5f5c-8bfc-4179-9c15-cc2e42f070d8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45502.13800360653588701.e4f4e263-e0f4-4c1e-a018-320e51651016.cd4eb9e9-5ad6-4f4b-81a8-ee994ad38dc9","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Libre","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["25228GameMotionStudio.GrandPrixHeroPro_t5x6bekc08gee"],"ContentIds":["5ab70532-80fd-ae9e-13d8-bbb542fd03e1","85c1b2c8-a646-ebb4-5704-2a9e1ddb4b1d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Race across multiple continents in this Grand Prix game.

Use the dark shadows\r\nWatch your stealth visibility indicator at the bottom/right of the screen closely to see how visible you are.

Use gadgets wisely\r\nAs you complete missions you're arsenal of gadgets and gear expands, but your resources remain limited. Use your ammunition wisely throughout the missions as you may come cross critical situations when you will desperately need your weapons.\r\n3. Drag guards into the shadow\r\nTo avoid any later detection of knocked out guards you need to be sure to drag them out of sight into a dark corner or behind cover. Detection of a guards leads to the alarm being raised and will negatively impact your stealth % score.\r\n4. Be patient\r\nThey key to any stealth game is to be patient and observe the situation and then take measured and planning action accordingly.\r\n\r\nYour gadgets\r\nComplete missions and you will be rewarded by the syndicate with new high-tech gadgets allowing you to complete the most challenging heists against all odds. Pay close attention to the gadget training missions.\r\n\r\nThe jobs\r\nThis stealth game presents a simulation of the life of a pro modern criminal.

Colors lets toddlers and preschoolers learn to recognize colors and name them in ways that are really fun.\r\n\r\nThe game is from Intellijoy. We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG7H2","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spirit of Wandering - The Legend HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.63144.9007199266303223.477aa454-a7e8-4fd3-a467-26d7bf7cf2bf.597b1996-e02b-432c-b633-3372ef2855fa","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.12564.9007199266303223.4dc5f019-43fe-48c9-ac9c-03bd848b777d.1af7eacd-918c-4bc7-a1e2-424642872930","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.23022.9007199266303223.bf63e895-9d9f-46cf-a7c5-70b5a6f1664c.80ef55c6-a559-4639-a3a4-d4c22b5bc77a","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.8277.9007199266303223.56b6623e-6a7e-4d56-97c4-e9da5c4d6d2e.a7c6fc10-8c65-45b4-a1db-46fa1105c31f","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.27946.9007199266303223.7b3c2114-f941-4ce4-8abe-fae341516c8e.35efa978-1f95-4efb-9585-f0abd03e85aa","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.599.9007199266303223.ce3159ce-b425-40ec-b0b9-6b3d52b0d557.f17a7840-d329-405e-9d59-09183c09da26","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Libre⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.1,"RatingsCount":"11","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.SpiritofWandering-TheLegend_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["870fa6da-8001-4847-35e8-9c00113bc5b5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Sail the seas with a pirate captain in search of her missing love in this adventurous, hidden-object quest! \r\nAfter an attack by the Flying Dutchman, the crew of the Spirit of Wandering and captain’s companion, Jack, were imprisoned in the spirit world.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US:

You’ve just found the most original coin dozer casino simulator that blends perfectly with your world explorer and treasure hunting games taste! Our unique arcade provides not only the classic coin dropper gameplay, but it mixes it with a treasure hunt for giving you a unique coin dozer experience in different level locations like: Treasure Cave, Gold of Ra, Diamond Rock & Temple of Venus!\r\n\r\nThe infamous red-bearded pirate left behind his treasure maps!  It seems like your luck already started changing because now, you have all the treasures locations. Begin your treasure hunt quest now, to collect all the coins & prizes of the huge lots inside the chests. Be careful though; the red-bearded pirate left some traps & fake treasure chests to keep safe his gold coins & jewels. The traps can cause that most of the coins and goodies fall to the sides of the dozer machine; so be really careful when you tap!\r\n\r\n💰🔦💰 Let the treasures chase & the coin dash dozer fun action begins! Download NOW Coin Dozer: Treasure Quest and enjoy the tons of prizes & high winning rates! 💰🔦💰\r\n\r\nNot familiar with Coin Dozer free games rules? No problem! It works almost the same like the real coin pusher games machines, and you’ll see a short video tutorial. Tap the pusher to make coins drop on it. All the coins or prizes that fall on the sides won’t be counted on your balance. The main goal is to drop coins & have them pushing over the front edge of the platforms. Our game includes incredible boosters that will help you on your cash collect quest. Check every booster special power & actions in the help section to build your winner strategy! Use the power ups wisely, as some of them don’t regenerate so fast as others. Gain XP points to increase your experience bar and unlock more maps and game levels.

You can activate it when it reaches one of the three levels: Low, Medium or High. Activating this feature shakes the table making the coins on the edge fall off the table. Collect 4 or more coins at once to trigger a Coin Attack; this will create and spread special goodies, prizes and puzzle pieces. Once you collect all the gold puzzle pieces, 12 to be exact, you’ll open the secret door of the room which contains a huge amount of rewards. Puzzle mini games unlock at level 5, and from there each level of our dozer has a puzzle mini-game to solve.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4TTCG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Diep IO Adventure","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63956.13510798887614899.8761a7dd-2615-43e1-88c4-5e5e472ccbf0.5eb119a6-d58e-492e-b645-1ed81cb8c211","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#B52DFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3513.13510798887614899.57fedf26-3003-4787-96c2-2646e0b1abc0.dfcb3eee-6130-4641-b5a3-8c78bfef0fcb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#B52DFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4523.13510798887614899.ee4a2a6b-e162-4852-959c-96018df5ec03.31554444-241a-4c58-86d6-3643ff33313c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#B52DFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Libre","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["37442SublimeCo.DiepIOAdventure_15r1cmjbwty0t"],"ContentIds":["cd9583b3-9a21-9747-fe7a-4c7cc7786df2","cfbccf21-93ea-4155-74a8-377875ed3fa9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Download and play Diep IO Adventure on fullscreen.\r\nDiep IO Adventure is a tank battle arena.\r\nDefeat enemy tanks.\r\nUpgrade your tank.\r\n16 Different kinds of tanks so far, more to come.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4V2F3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Ultimate Anime Quiz","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51696.13510798887489734.0bfc4700-2005-4c91-9d8f-630a4a510b88.827967db-2041-4e7f-9220-7a6f74fa05d0","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15001.13510798887489734.2a92ff3d-0d45-4232-8cb7-c7a01ec3a728.0d453071-45f6-4bfb-91df-93255b81773d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Libre⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["47973borneomobile.UltimateAnimeQuiz_hjdz3r29yebja"],"ContentIds":["6e60b420-e0e3-5848-98b5-ee14ddbabc2f","2d8c9eac-eae4-e01d-7bd0-02685bdf8d42"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Ultimate Anime Quiz is an anime game for the otaku, those with interest in anime and manga fandom. \r\n\r\nThis game contains  anime characters from Death Note, Sword Art Online, Fullmetal Alchemist, Code Geass, Naruto, Bleach, Angle Beats, Elfen Lied, basically all the popular anime series and movies.\r\n\r\nThere are 5 levels in this manga game, each contains 50 pictures of anime characters.
