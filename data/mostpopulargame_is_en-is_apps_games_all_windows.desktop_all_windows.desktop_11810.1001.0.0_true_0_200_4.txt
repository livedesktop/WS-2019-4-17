The killer whale is in a ferocious mood. The thrill of controlling a fierce angry whale is unmatchable. Angry whale simulator 2016 is a super animal simulator and gives you a chance to watch and simulate a killer whale attack in deep sea and on the beach. So dive into the ocean and be a part of this adventure as an Angry Whale as this orca knows no stopping.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal simulators give you the opportunity to observe the wildlife and sea animal life from a close perspective. Angry Whale Simulator 2016 will give you that chance of controlling a whale that attacks and eat underwater animals and humans alike. The Orca whale experience is better than the shark jaws or piranha. Whales are huge animals that can stay both in deep and shallow waters and once they come close to surface, can run havoc on the beach and the boats.

The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model. That is useful when you just start, so the model never gets away. \r\n\r\nPlease try our full featured professional RC flight simulator ClearView for PC here: http://rcflightsim.com - see the video of ClearView bellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n1.

The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe. You will experience both city and off-road environment and view many scenic views of mountains and hills while you are driving in the snowy conditions. Drive the extreme snow bus drive away!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the game. Your comments & ratings are welcome and will help us in creating even better games for you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4S7B8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Monster High Dress Up","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26069.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.09a84f3d-73cf-4899-b741-38a4491229e1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7852.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.5623eb27-8271-4cba-9d28-4832cbad2cf0","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40329.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.a9d76c7f-28cd-489a-b18d-e20e973115be","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28818.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.7ce63c60-3759-4a1a-ae78-133bb34e0fa4","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14365.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.e60d6f0b-953f-4fea-a3df-538e5947297b","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36490.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.8154f88f-04e5-48d7-8d60-9bc3dc9b0f20","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35428.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.becb2614-6b41-4648-b7e2-3b847e31698d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45083.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.531a1cd5-c6f1-42fa-8765-4634ed8fca84","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55824.13510798887573143.a825e4e7-fdb7-42e2-a8a2-6c752f069032.81cb76de-45a0-460b-92aa-38c62ad70a10","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28704.13510798887573143.856c912e-77b1-4cb1-a07b-bbff8bb4efbe.0b9c4582-30e4-4dff-9dfe-acd0eb40da2d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#3E0B43","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2468AppolloGame.MonsterHigh_a6h44nqn6pbdm"],"ContentIds":["01617f63-05d9-71b6-03af-a46e552a3ba7","41f87c26-ed58-8a1c-1416-57ef1f7126ae","8db5a44a-f12b-e9ce-9e6b-8270638f4249","d51367ba-fbe0-be53-6563-280c76f61061","dc3c7608-b500-d376-8738-7ea096396a3f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Monster High Dress Up application created for lovers of Monster High.
